A text-based Python Blackjack game

To play, change directory into the folder and run the command 'python blackjack.py' in the command line

Rules:

The player is given a bankroll of $100 to start. 

Each turn, the player is asked how much they want to bet on the hand.
Two cards are dealt to the player, and one card is dealt to the dealer.
The player is then asked whether they want to:
	hit (take another card)
	stay (pass their turn to the dealer)
	double-down (double the bet, but only receive one more card)

The object of the game is to get as close to, but not over, 21.
If either the player or the dealer go over 21, then they lose.
The player with the highest total at the end of the game wins.

The game will continue until either: the player quits or the player runs out of money

Good luck!
